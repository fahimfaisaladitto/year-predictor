# Features
• Modern "Glassmorphism" UI: A beautiful, blurred background card design that is popular in modern web applications.

• Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

• Dark Mode: A stylish dark mode with a smooth toggle switch. The user's theme preference is saved in their browser for future visits.

• Dynamic Feedback: When the user clicks "Predict," a loading animation appears with cycling messages to provide an engaging user experience.

• Dynamic Placeholder: The input field's placeholder text dynamically updates to show the current year.

• Simple and Intuitive: A clean, single-purpose interface that is easy for anyone to use.

# How to Use
1. Open the Application: Simply open the link in any modern web browser.

2. Enter a Year: Type any valid year into the input field.

3. Predict: Click the "Predict Next Year" button.

4. View the Result: After a short animation, the application will display the following year.

5. Toggle Dark Mode: Use the toggle switch in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark themes.

# Technologies Used
• HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the application.

• CSS3: For custom styling, animations, and the implementation of the glassmorphism effect using CSS variables.

• Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid layout and component styling.

• JavaScript (ES6): For all the application's logic, including:

• Handling user input and button clicks.

• Implementing the prediction and loading animations.

• Managing the dark mode state and saving it to localStorage.

• Dynamically setting the placeholder text.

# Project Structure
<h4 align="left"> The project is organized into three separate files for better maintainability: </h4>

• index.html: This file contains the core structure and content of the web application. It links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.

• style.css: This file holds all the custom CSS, including theme variables for light/dark modes, animations, and specific component styles.

• script.js: This file contains all the JavaScript code that powers the application's functionality, including the prediction logic and dark mode toggle.

# Setup and Installation
<h4 align="left">Since this project uses basic web technologies with no external dependencies (other than CDN links), the setup is straightforward.</h4>

1. Clone or Download: Get a copy of all three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js).

2. Keep Files Together: Ensure that all three files are located in the same folder or directory.

2. Open in Browser: Right-click the index.html file and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

<h4 align="left">  That's it! The application will be running locally on your machine. </h4>
